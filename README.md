# Jamf -> Slack Patch Notifer

Patch Notifier is a utility script to send messages en-masse to users with patches to complete. This is done by checking Jamf's Patch Management and compiling a list of patches for each device, and then messaging whomever is assigned the laptop.

Help documentation is automatically generated by ArgParse. To see up-to-date help information use `python3 patch-notifier.py -h`

# Credentials
Add JAMF_PATCH_USER and JAMF_PATCH_PASS to your .env, using a read-only Jamf account.

You will also need a Slack App added to your workspace, with the following user token scopes:
* chat:write
* users:read
* users:read.email
* identity.email

Once set up, add SLACK_MAILER_TOKEN into your .env and assign your user OAuth token.

# Testing
You can find a laptop’s ID in Jamf by navigating to it, and under the ‘General’ tab you should see Jamf Pro Computer ID: <device_id> . You can also see the ID in the URL, as an ‘id’ query.
